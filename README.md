## 👨‍💻 About Me

QA Engineer with a strong technical foundation in systems and infrastructure.

I specialize in structured, risk-based testing with a strong focus on API validation, SQL data verification, and automation reliability.  
My approach to quality is system-oriented — aiming to identify risks early and reduce downstream defects, with validation beyond the UI layer.

I value clarity, reproducibility, and stability in both manual and automated testing.

## 💡 What I Bring to a Team

- Structured and risk-based test design mindset  
- Strong requirement analysis before execution  
- API and backend validation capability  
- SQL-based data verification and consistency checks  
- Clear, actionable, and impact-focused defect reporting  
- Automation stability focus (prevent flaky & shared-state issues)  
- System-level thinking beyond UI behavior

## 🎓 QA Foundation & Quality Strategy

### 🔎 Requirement & Risk Analysis
- Acceptance Criteria validation  
- Impact analysis across system components  
- Understanding of QA role across SDLC phases  
- Risk-based prioritization  

### 🧪 Test Design Techniques
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)  
- Equivalence Partitioning (EP)  
- Decision Table Testing  
- State Transition Testing  
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)  
- Test data strategy & edge-case identification  

### 🐞 Defect & Reporting Discipline
- Structured bug reports (clear reproduction + business impact)  
- Severity vs Priority evaluation  
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) awareness  

---

## 🔍 Technical QA Focus

### 🌐 API Testing
- HTTP methods & status code validation  
- Request/response structure verification  
- JSON schema & payload validation  
- Environment & variable management (Postman)  
- Request chaining & test scripting (expanding automation checks)  

### 💾 SQL & Data Validation
- CRUD verification  
- JOIN & relational integrity validation  
- Backend data consistency checks  
- Data integrity & constraint awareness  

### 🤖 Automation (Playwright)
- Automation principles (what/when to automate)  
- Locator strategy (CSS, XPath)  
- Page Object Model fundamentals  
- Deterministic and isolated test execution design  
- Flakiness prevention strategies  

---

## 🧠 QA Philosophy

- Quality should be built early, not tested at the end.  
- Good test design prevents defects before execution.  
- Backend validation is as important as UI validation.  
- Automation must reduce risk, not introduce instability.  
- Tests should be deterministic, isolated, and reproducible.
