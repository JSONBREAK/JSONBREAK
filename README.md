## 👨‍💻 About Me

QA Engineer with a technical foundation in systems and backend validation.

I focus on structured, risk-based testing and reliable automation design.  
My approach emphasizes early risk detection, backend-level validation, and deterministic test execution to reduce instability in CI environments.

I value clarity, reproducibility, and stable execution across both manual and automated testing.

## 💡 What I Bring to a Team

- Risk-based and requirement-driven test design
- API and backend validation beyond UI checks
- SQL-based data verification and relational consistency checks
- Clear, reproducible, and impact-focused defect reporting
- Automation design focused on determinism and isolation
- Awareness of shared-state and async-related instability

## 🧪 Technical Focus

### 🌐 API Testing
- HTTP methods & status code validation  
- JSON structure and payload verification  
- Environment & variable management (Postman)  
- Request chaining & validation logic  

### 💾 SQL & Data Validation
- CRUD verification  
- JOINs and relational integrity validation  
- Backend data consistency checks  
- Data integrity and constraint awareness  
- Deterministic and isolated test execution  

### 🤖 Automation (Playwright)
- Practical JavaScript for test automation  
- Locator strategy (CSS, XPath)  
- Test isolation and shared state prevention  
- Flakiness prevention strategies  

---

## 🔬 Practical QA Execution

- Designed and executed API test scenarios covering positive, negative, and edge cases
- Built Playwright automation for authentication and CRUD flows
- Performed SQL validation to verify relational data consistency
- Identified and documented reproducible defects with clear impact analysis
- Structured test data to prevent shared-state instability

## 🟦 Automation Reliability & JavaScript

Strong understanding of JavaScript behavior and its impact on automation stability:

- Immutability & defensive copying  
- Reference vs value behavior awareness  
- Avoiding hidden mutation across test cases  
- Structured data transformation (map, filter, reduce)  
- Async control (Promises, async/await)  
- Proper error handling and debugging awareness
