## 👨‍💻 About Me

QA Engineer with a systems-oriented mindset focused on backend validation and automation reliability.

I validate APIs, data integrity, and execution stability beyond surface-level UI checks.  
I design automation with isolation and reproducibility in mind to reduce flakiness in CI pipelines.

My goal is to provide reliable quality signals that enable teams to ship with confidence.

## 🟦 Automation Reliability & JavaScript

Strong understanding of JavaScript behavior and its impact on automation stability:

- Immutability & defensive copying  
- Reference vs value behavior awareness  
- Avoiding hidden mutation across test cases  
- Structured data transformation (map, filter, reduce)  
- Async control (Promises, async/await)  
- Proper error handling and debugging awareness
